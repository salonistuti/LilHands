## Problem Statement:
The project aims to solve the global crisis if maternal health and mortality. The World Health Organisation estimates that
 more than 295,000 women die a year from pregnancy related causes. The truth is that most
 maternal deaths are actually preventable, as the health-care solutions to prevent or manage
 complications are well known. All women need is access to high quality care in pregnancy,
 and during and after childbirth. 

## Solved Problems:
### 1. Maternal Mortality Reduction:
The primary motivation is to address the staggering number of preventable maternal deaths worldwide. By providing access to high-quality prenatal, childbirth, and postpartum care, the project aims to reduce the number of women dying due to pregnancy-related causes.
### 2. Access to Healthcare:
Rural and indigenous communities often lack access to adequate healthcare facilities, especially during pregnancy and childbirth. By offering affordable or free tele-health options, the project aims to bridge this gap and ensure that pregnant individuals receive timely medical advice and support regardless of their geographical location.
### Doula and Midwife Support:
To improve birth outcomes and maternal satisfaction. However, finding a suitable match can be challenging, especially in underserved areas. The digital matching service aims to connect pregnant individuals with trained birth companions who can offer emotional and physical support throughout the pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum period.
### High-Risk Pregnancy Management:
Identifying and tracking high-risk pregnancies is crucial for ensuring timely intervention and reducing complications. By implementing a feature to track high-risk pregnancies and coordinate transport facilities, the project aims to ensure that pregnant individuals with additional medical needs receive appropriate care without delay.
### Resource Matching:
Many expecting and new parents, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, struggle to afford essential prenatal and postpartum resources. By offering a platform to match individuals with free or reduced-cost prenatal vitamins, baby supplies, birthing classes, and support groups, the project aims to alleviate financial barriers and promote healthier outcomes for both parents and babies.
### Postpartum Support:
The postpartum period can be challenging, both emotionally and physically, for new parents. By implementing a postpartum bot check-in, the project aims to provide ongoing support and guidance to new parents, ensuring that they receive the necessary care and resources during this critical time.
